Jollof rice is probably the most important Nigerian dish. Main ingredients: rice and tomatoes. Nigeria is the largest producer of tomatoes in Africa, after Egypt. A developing nation selling its cheap product to some rich western countries? Quite the opposite here. Nigeria is also the largest importer. Tomatoes perish quickly if they are not processed. The low-price imports and other factors keep the local industry underdeveloped. As a result, 75% of Nigerian production is wasted and farmers are left in debts. This problem is common to other African economies. Using the words of Prof. Zuma from Harvard University: "[EU] suppress technological innovation and industrial development among African countries".',
